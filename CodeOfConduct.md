Below is a code of conduct expected of all members of the Kyokan-MetaMask team.

# Team Member Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an healthy and empowering work environment, we as
Kyokan-MetaMask team members pledge to make our workplace and the projects we work with harassment-free spaces for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or anything else.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the team and our communities
* Showing empathy towards other team and community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all meetings and async communication spaces, and also when
we are meeting in person. The expectations we set hear apply to how we treat each other within our team, how we treat people who work on MetaMask and other projects we collaborate within, open source contributors to projects we work on and all others  we interact with.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by any of us to any of us and will be addressed immediately. Violations of this code of conduct will likely be considered a fireable offense.
